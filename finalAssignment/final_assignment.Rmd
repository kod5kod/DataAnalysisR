# 52414 Final Assignment
![](http://community.globaleditorsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/styles/project_presentation/public/680x2602x.jpg?itok=mUi201So)  

**The final assignment is based on an article published by 
[*FiveThirtyEight*](http://fivethirtyeight.com/). In the article, the author investigated differences between male and female superheroes in comic books: [*Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/). In this assignment, you will not only try to reproduce some of the findings with a more up-do-date data, but will also dive deeper into the data to provide meaningful insights backed by statistical analysis.**  

a. Do not use libraries outside of the required libraries.  
b. It is recommended to read the 538 article.  

### 1) Data Loading and Cleaning  

*Load the `heroes`,`powers`, and the `details` datasets.*  
```{r Loading Data}
df_heroes <- read.csv("", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df_powers <- read.csv("", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df_details <- readLines("")
```

  
a. Using kable, show the first 10 rows of the `heroes` dataframe.  

b. Note that there are two types of NA's in the dataset: `-` and `-99`. Write a script that goes over each column of the dataframe and counts how many `-` and how many `-99` appears in each column.  

c. We would like to replace all of the above instances. Write another script that goes over the columns and replaces all the `-` to `otherNA` and `-99` to `NA`. Using kable, show the first 10 rows of the resulting dataframe.  

*Next we will parse and clean the `details` dataset:*  

d. Currently, the `details` data is loaded as a character vector. Parse the vector and transalte it into a dataframe containing two columns: power_name(chr) and power_score(double).  

### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis

**We are going to concetrate our analysis on the gender disparity and representation of Comics superheroes.**   
  
a. Make a plot of the gender distribution (total, not intersected with any other variable). 
  
*Run the script in the box below. We can see that 'DC Comics' & 'Marvel Comics' are the two major players in the comics industry. Let's focus our analysis on these two companies.* 
  
**For the rest of the analysis, we will concetrate only on comics by `DC Comics` and `Marvel Comics`. **  
  
b. Make a plot comparing the gender distribution of superheroes in DC Comics vs Marvel

c. Make the same plot as above, but this time take `Alignment` into consideration as well.  
  
d. Are the gender differences between the two publishers statistically significant? Use a parametric test for that. 

### 3) Diving Deeper

*Beside the gender ratio of superheroes and their alignment, we can also investigate their character representation.*  

a. Count the number of powers for each superhero using the 'powers' dataset and add this count as a column `pwrs_cnt` to the `powers` dataframe. Join the `pwrs_cnt` column to the `heroes` dataframe.    

b. Make a plot showing the distribution of `pwrs_cnt` for each of the genders. 

c. Check if the distribution of `pwrs_cnt` by gender follows the normal distribution.  

d. Use a location test to test if there is a difference between the gender power counts.  


### 4) The Stochastic Universe  

a. Use Montecarlo methods to calculate the probability that a random team of 4 female superheros will overcome (total powers will be greater) a random team of 4 male superheros.

b. Suppose DC Comics selects randomly and independently whether to choose a male or a female superhero:
	Write a Montecarlo simulation to test the hypothesis that the probability for choosing a female hero is 0.5. Use the observed number of heros.  

	  
### 5) Your Own Take  

Show graphically one interesting insight you have found in the provided datasets - this can be unrelated to the gender analysis we have carried.
