# 52414 Final Assignment
![](http://community.globaleditorsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/styles/project_presentation/public/680x2602x.jpg?itok=mUi201So)  

**The final assignment is based on an article published by 
[*FiveThirtyEight*](http://fivethirtyeight.com/). In the article, the author investigated differences between male and female superheroes in comic books: [*Comic Books Are Still Made By Men, For Men And About Men*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/). In this assignment, you will not only try to reproduce some of the findings with a more up-do-date data, but will also dive deeper into the data to provide meaningful insights backed by statistical analysis.**  

a. Do not use libraries outside of the required libraries.  
b. It is recommended to read the 538 article.  

### 1) Data Loading and Cleaning  

*Load the `heroes`,`powers`, and the `details` datasets.*  
```{r Loading Data}
df_heroes <- read.csv(("C:/Users/user/Desktop/heroes.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df_powers <- read.csv(("C:/Users/user/Desktop/powers.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df_details <- readLines("C:/Users/user/Desktop/details.txt")

```

  
a. Using kable, show the first 10 rows of the `heroes` dataframe.  
```{r}
kable(df_heroes[1:10,])
```
b. Note that there are two types of NA's in the dataset: `-` and `-99`. Write a script that goes over each column of the dataframe and counts how many `-` and how many `-99` appears in each column.  
```{r}


A<-sum(str_count(df_heroes, pattern = "-"))
A
B<-sum(str_count(df_heroes, pattern = "-99"))
B

```
c. We would like to replace all of the above instances. Write another script that goes over the columns and replaces all the `-` to `otherNA` and `-99` to `NA`. Using kable, show the first 10 rows of the resulting dataframe.  
```{r}

df_heroes[df_heroes=="-"]<-"otherNA"
df_heroes[df_heroes=="-99"]<-"NA"
kable(df_heroes[1:10,])

```
*Next we will parse and clean the `details` dataset:*  

d. Currently, the `details` data is loaded as a character vector. Parse the vector and transalte it into a dataframe containing two columns: power_name(chr) and power_score(double).  

```{r}



df_details<- df_details[ df_details != ""]

df <- unlist(str_split(string = df_details, pattern = "\\+"))
df<-as.data.frame((matrix(df,ncol=2, byrow =T)))
names(df)<-c("power_name","power_score")


```
### 2) Exploratory Data Analysis

**We are going to concetrate our analysis on the gender disparity and representation of Comics superheroes.**   
  
a. Make a plot of the gender distribution (total, not intersected with any other variable). 

```{R}
df_heroes<-df_heroes%>%filter(Gender== "Male" | Gender=="Female")
df_heroes%>%ggplot(aes(Gender))+ geom_bar() + ggtitle("Total gender distribution")+ylab("Number of superheroes")

```

*Run the script in the box below. We can see that 'DC Comics' & 'Marvel Comics' are the two major players in the comics industry. Let's focus our analysis on these two companies.* 
  
**For the rest of the analysis, we will concetrate only on comics by `DC Comics` and `Marvel Comics`. **  
  
b. Make a plot comparing the gender distribution of superheroes in DC Comics vs Marvel

```{r}


df_heroes_new<-df_heroes%>%filter(Publisher== "DC Comics" | Publisher=="Marvel Comics")
df_heroes_new%>%ggplot(aes(Publisher,fill=Gender))+ geom_bar(position = "dodge")+ggtitle("Gender distribution of superheroes in DC Comics vs Marvel")+ylab("Number of superheroes")

#In the plot we can see that there is less female superheroes in both Publishers comics.
```
c. Make the same plot as above, but this time take `Alignment` into consideration as well.  


```{r}


df_heroes_new<-df_heroes%>%filter(Publisher== "DC Comics" | Publisher=="Marvel Comics")
df_heroes_new%>%ggplot(aes(Publisher,col= Gender, fill=Alignment))+ geom_bar(position = "dodge",alpha=0.4)+ggtitle("Gender distribution of superheroes in DC vs Marvel with Alignment ")+ylab("Number of superheroes")
                                                                            
                      
```

d. Are the gender differences between the two publishers statistically significant? Use a parametric test for that. 

```{r}
DC<-df_heroes%>%filter(Publisher== "DC Comics") 
f1<-sum(DC$Gender=="Female")
m1<-sum(DC$Gender=="Male")

Marvel <-df_heroes%>%filter(Publisher== "Marvel Comics") 
f2<-sum(Marvel$Gender=="Female")
m2<-sum(Marvel$Gender=="Male")

z.prop = function(f1,f2,m1,m2){
  numerator = (f1/m1) - (f2/m2)
  p.common = (f1+f2) / (m1+m2)
  denominator = sqrt(p.common * (1-p.common) * (1/m1 + 1/m2))
  z.prop.ris = numerator / denominator
  return(z.prop.ris)
}
z.prop(f1,f2,m1,m2)

#|z.prop|<1.96 We can conclude that there is no significant gender differences between the two publishers.
```

### 3) Diving Deeper

*Beside the gender ratio of superheroes and their alignment, we can also investigate their character representation.*  

a. Count the number of powers for each superhero using the 'powers' dataset and add this count as a column `pwrs_cnt` to the `powers` dataframe. Join the `pwrs_cnt` column to the `heroes` dataframe.    

```{r}
pwrs_cnt<-rowSums(df_powers=="True")
df_powers$pwrs_cnt<-pwrs_cnt
df_powers_new<-select(df_powers,hero_names,pwrs_cnt)
colnames(df_powers_new)[colnames(df_powers_new)=="hero_names"] <- "name"
df_heroes<-left_join(df_heroes,df_powers_new,by = "name")
df_heroes[1:10]
```
b. Make a plot showing the distribution of `pwrs_cnt` for each of the genders. 


```{r}
df_heroes %>% ggplot(aes(pwrs_cnt, fill=Gender)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.7)+ggtitle("The distribution of `pwrs_cnt` for each of the genders")

```

c. Check if the distribution of `pwrs_cnt` by gender follows the normal distribution.  

```{r}
pwrs_cnt_m<-df_heroes%>%select(pwrs_cnt,Gender)%>%filter( pwrs_cnt !="NA") 
pwrs_cnt_m<-pwrs_cnt_m%>%select(pwrs_cnt,Gender)%>%filter( Gender=="Male")
sum(pwrs_cnt_m[,1])
average_m <- sum(pwrs_cnt_m[,1]) / length(pwrs_cnt_m[,1])
SD_m <- sqrt( sum( (pwrs_cnt_m[,1]-average_m)^2) / length(pwrs_cnt_m[,1]) )

p <- seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
observed_quantiles_m <- quantile(pwrs_cnt_m[1], p, na.rm=TRUE)
theoretical_quantiles_m <- qnorm( p, mean = average_m, sd = SD_m)
qq.data <- data.frame(theoretical_quantiles=theoretical_quantiles_m, observed_quantiles=observed_quantiles_m)
ggplot(data = qq.data, aes(x=theoretical_quantiles_m,y= observed_quantiles_m))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="red")+
  ggtitle("q-q plot - Male")


pwrs_cnt_f<-df_heroes%>%select(pwrs_cnt,Gender)%>%filter( pwrs_cnt !="NA") 
pwrs_cnt_f<-pwrs_cnt_f%>%select(pwrs_cnt,Gender)%>%filter( Gender=="Female")
sum(pwrs_cnt_f[,1])
average_f <- sum(pwrs_cnt_f[,1]) / length(pwrs_cnt_f[,1])
SD_f <- sqrt( sum( (pwrs_cnt_f[,1]-average_f)^2) / length(pwrs_cnt_f[,1]) )

observed_quantiles_f <- quantile(pwrs_cnt_f[,1], p, na.rm=TRUE)
theoretical_quantiles_f <- qnorm( p, mean = average_f, sd = SD_f)
qq.data <- data.frame(theoretical_quantiles=theoretical_quantiles_f, observed_quantiles=observed_quantiles_f)
ggplot(data = qq.data, aes(x=theoretical_quantiles_f,y= observed_quantiles_f))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="green")+
  ggtitle("q-q plot - Female")

#With the qq-plot we can see than the distribution of number of powers is close enough to be called Normal.

```

d. Use a location test to test if there is a difference between the gender power counts.  

```{r}
cdm<-average_m
cdf<-average_f
samp_stat<-function(cdm,cdf){
  dms<-sample(size = length(pwrs_cnt_m[,1]),cdm,replace = T)
  dfs<-sample(size = length(pwrs_cnt_f[,1]),cdf,replace = T)
  mean(dms)-mean(dfs)}
B=1000
vec=NULL
for (b in 1:B) {
 vec[b]<- samp_stat(cdf,cdm)
  
}

pVAL <-  mean(vec<(average_f-average_m))

```


### 4) The Stochastic Universe  

a. Use Montecarlo methods to calculate the probability that a random team of 4 female superheros will overcome (total powers will be greater) a random team of 4 male superheros.
```{r}

f<-rnorm(100000,average_f-average_m,SD_f+SD_m)
a<-c(1:100000)
mont_car_val<-function(f,j){
  for(i in 1:100000){
  a[i]<-(sum(sample(f,4))>=0)
        
  }
  sum(a)/100000
}
mont_car_val(f,4)

```

b. Suppose DC Comics selects randomly and independently whether to choose a male or a female superhero:
	Write a Montecarlo simulation to test the hypothesis that the probability for choosing a female hero is 0.5. Use the observed number of heros.  

```{r}

p_f<-sum(DC$Gender=="Female")/(length(DC[,1]))
DC_select<-rnorm(100000,p_f,sqrt(p_f*(1-p_f)))
sum(DC_select)/100000

```
	  
### 5) Your Own Take  

Show graphically one interesting insight you have found in the provided datasets - this can be unrelated to the gender analysis we have carried. 

```{r}

df_heroes%>%ggplot(aes(Hair.color))+ geom_bar()  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
#Most superheroues got regular color hair(blond, black, brown).
```
